        <text>Formerly called the "VIP Alpha" series, the Special Correspondence series is a unique collection of letters and memoranda received by the President from distinguished public figures and close friends.  Material may be found filed by name of correspondent or by person discussed in the correspondence, the criteria being inconsistent at the time of filing. There are three kinds of items: notes and letters from or concerning the President's family and friends; correspondence from members of the President's staff, advisers and non-government officials; and letters from prominent public figures.  Former presidents, foreign heads of state, religious leaders, distinguished Congressmen, and well-known artists and writers are among those whose letters were placed in this series by Mrs. Lincoln. Of particular interest are letters from Herbert Hoover, Harry Truman, Dwight Eisenhower, Winston Churchill, Eleanor Roosevelt, Pope John XXIII, Pope Paul VI, Pablo Casals, and Robert Frost.  For the most part, this material is of an unofficial nature, and represents the personal feelings, thoughts and dvice of the writers on matters not falling under official responsibilities. The Special Correspondence series is arranged alphabetically by name of correspondent. See also Series 1. General Corresponence, Series 6. Staff Memoranda, Series 9. Countries, and the Series 7. Departments and Agencies. Users should also refer to the White House Name Files in seeking all correspondence from a particular person.</text>
