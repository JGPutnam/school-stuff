Hi.  I'm James.  I've just finished my 1st year at Simmons GSLIS.  English is my 1st language but the internet is becoming my second.  I love books and reading and writing and being part of exciting things.  I hope someday to have a career that satisfies my ambitions.  I like surfing the web, tennis, indoor mountain  climbing, snowboarding, music, weightlifting, self-improvement, books, movies, and food.</p></div>
